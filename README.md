# Elliott Faa - Computer Science Student at Georgia Tech

## About Me
I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech whose interests span **computer graphics**, **high-performance computing**, and **full-stack development**.

### Key Projects

#### [Web-Based 3D Graphics Renderer](https://github.com/ElliottF05/3D-Graphics) ([Interactive Demo](https://elliottf05.github.io/3D-Graphics/))
- **Technologies:** C++, WebAssembly, TypeScript, Supabase, PostgreSQL
- A fully custom-built 3D graphics renderer combining rasterization and ray-tracing, featuring real-time interactivity, multi-threading, and cross-platform execution via WebAssembly.

#### [Spotify Wrapped Android App (Group Project)](https://sites.google.com/view/spotify-project-team-website/home)
- **Technologies:** Java, Android, Firebase, Spotify API, OpenAI's LLM
- An Android app that generates personalized Spotify Wrapped summaries with real-time song playback, AI-generated insights, and secure cross-device storage using Firebase.

#### [Interactive Pathfinding Visualizer](https://github.com/ElliottF05/pathfinding-visualizer) ([Interactive Demo](https://elliottf05.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/))
- **Technologies:** React, TypeScript, CSS
- Visualizes real-time pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*) with customizable grids, obstacle drawing, and adjustable speeds for interactive learning and exploration.

#### [Interactive Fractal Zoom Generator](https://github.com/ElliottF05/mandelbrot-zoom)
- **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Numba
- A tool that allows users to explore the Mandelbrot fractal with real-time zooming and navigation, optimized with Numba's CPU parallelization for smooth performance.

#### [Gravity Simulation](https://github.com/ElliottF05/Gravity-Game)
- **Technologies:** Python, Pygame, NumPy, Numba
- An interactive gravity simulation modeling orbital mechanics, featuring real-time updates, high-performance time acceleration, and dynamic visualization of celestial bodies.
