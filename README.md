# Elliott Faa - Computer Science Student at Georgia Tech

## About Me
I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech whose interests span **computer graphics**, **high-performance computing**, and **full-stack development**.

### Key Projects

#### [3D Graphics Renderer - Interactive Demo](https://elliottf05.github.io/3D-Graphics/)
- **Technologies:** C++, WebAssembly, TypeScript, Supabase, PostgreSQL
- A fully custom-built 3D graphics renderer that combines rasterization and ray-tracing for real-time and high-quality renders. It features real-time interactivity, multi-threading, and cross-platform execution in web browsers.
  
#### [Spotify Wrapped Android App (Group Project)](https://sites.google.com/view/spotify-project-team-website/home)
- **Technologies:** Java, Android, Firebase, Spotify API, OpenAI's LLM
- An Android app that integrates with Spotify to generate personalized Wrapped summaries for users, featuring real-time Spotify song playback, secure storage with Firebase, and AI-generated insights into users' listening habits.

#### [Interactive Pathfinding Visualizer](https://github.com/ElliottF05/Pathfinding-Visualizer)
- **Technologies:** React, JavaScript, CSS
- A visualizer for popular pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's and A*, allowing users to explore and understand how different algorithms navigate through grids with obstacles and custom paths.

#### [Gravity Simulation](https://github.com/ElliottF05/Gravity-Simulation)
- **Technologies:** Python, Pygame
- A simulation that models gravitational forces between celestial bodies. It features real-time movement and allows users to manipulate parameters like mass and velocity to observe different behaviors.

#### [Mandelbrot Visualizer](https://github.com/ElliottF05/Mandelbrot-Visualizer)
- **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
- A tool to visualize the Mandelbrot set, allowing users to zoom in and explore the fractal's intricate patterns, rendered efficiently using multi-threading for smooth performance.
